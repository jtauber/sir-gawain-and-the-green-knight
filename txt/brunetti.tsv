209	A spetos sparþe to expoun in spelle, quoso my3t.
210	Þe lenkþe of an eln3erde þe large hede hade,

228	To kny3tez he kest his y3e,

232	Ther watz lokyng on lenþe þe lude to beholde,
233	For vch mon had meruayle quat hit mene my3t

415	‘Gladly, sir, for soþe’,

597	Bi þat watz Gryngolet grayth, and gurde with a sadel
598	Þat glemed ful gayly with mony golde frenges,
599	Ayquere naylet ful nwe, for þat note ryched;

602	Þe cropore and þe couertor, acorded wyth þe arsounez;
603	And al watz rayled on red ryche golde naylez,
604	Þat al glytered and glent as glem of þe sunne.
605	Þenne hentes he þe helme, and hastily hit kysses,
606	Þat watz stapled stifly, and stoffed wythinne.
607	Hit watz hy3e on his hede, hasped bihynde,
608	Wyth a ly3tly vrysoun ouer þe auentayle,
609	Enbrawden and bounden wyth þe best gemmez
610	On brode sylkyn borde, and bryddez on semez,
611	As papiayez paynted peruyng bitwene,

615	Þe cercle watz more o prys
616	Þat vmbeclypped hys croun,
617	Of diamauntez a deuys
618	Þat boþe were bry3t and broun.
619	THEN þay schewed hym þe schelde, þat was of schyr goulez
620	Wyth þe pentangel depaynt of pure golde hwez.
621	He braydez hit by þe bauderyk, aboute þe hals kestes,
622	Þat bisemed þe segge semlyly fayre.
623	And quy þe pentangel apendez to þat prynce noble
624	I am in tent yow to telle, þof tary hyt me schulde:
625	Hit is a syngne þat Salamon set sumquyle
626	In bytoknyng of trawþe, bi tytle þat hit habbez,
627	For hit is a figure þat haldez fyue poyntez,

631	Forþy hit acordez to þis kny3t and to his cler armez,
632	For ay faythful in fyue and sere fyue syþez
633	Gawan watz for gode knawen, and as golde pured,
634	Voyded of vche vylany, wyth vertuez ennourned

636	Forþy þe pentangel nwe
637	He ber in schelde and cote,
638	As tulk of tale most trwe

640	Fyrst he watz funden fautlez in his fyue wyttez,
641	And efte fayled neuer þe freke in his fyue fyngres,
642	And alle his afyaunce vpon folde watz in þe fyue woundez
643	Þat Cryst ka3t on þe croys, as þe crede tellez;
644	And quere-so-euer þys mon in melly watz stad,
645	His þro þo3t watz in þat, þur3 alle oþer þyngez,
646	Þat alle his forsnes he feng at þe fyue joyez
647	Þat þe hende heuen-quene had of hir chylde;
648	At þis cause þe kny3t comlyche hade
649	In þe inore half of his schelde hir ymage depaynted,
650	Þat quen he blusched þerto his belde neuer payred.
651	Þe fyft fyue þat I finde þat þe frek vsed
652	Watz fraunchyse and fela3schyp forbe al þyng,
653	His clannes and his cortaysye croked were neuer,
654	And pité, þat passez alle poyntez, þyse pure fyue
655	Were harder happed on þat haþel þen on any oþer.
656	Now alle þese fyue syþez, for soþe, were fetled on þis kny3t,
657	And vchone halched in oþer, þat non ende hade,
658	And fyched vpon fyue poyntez, þat fayld neuer,
659	Ne samned neuer in no syde, ne sundred nouþer,
660	Withouten ende at any noke I oquere fynde,
661	Whereeuer þe gomen bygan, or glod to an ende.
662	Þerfore on his schene schelde schapen watz þe knot
663	Ryally wyth red golde vpon rede gowlez,
664	Þat is þe pure pentaungel wyth þe peple called
665	with lore.
666	Now grayþed is Gawan gay,
667	And la3t his launce ry3t þore,
668	And gef hem alle goud day,
669	He wende for euermore.
670	He sperred þe sted with þe spurez and sprong on his way,
671	So stif þat þe ston-fyr stroke out þerafter.
672	Al þat se3 þat semly syked in hert,
673	And sayde soþly al same segges til oþer,
674	Carande for þat comly: ‘Bi Kryst, hit is scaþe

703	And ay he frayned, as he ferde, at frekez þat he met,
704	If þay hade herde any karp of a kny3t grene,

2231	When he wan to þe watter, þer he wade nolde,
2232	He hypped ouer on hys ax, and orpedly strydez,

2235	Sir Gawayn þe kny3t con mete,

2237	Þat oþer sayde, ‘Now, sir swete,

2239	‘Gawayn,’ quoþ þat grene gome, ‘God þe mot loke!
2240	Iwysse þou art welcom, wy3e, to my place,

2250	‘Nay, bi God,’ quoþ Gawayn, ‘þat me gost lante,

2255	He lened with þe nek, and lutte,
2256	And schewed þat schyre al bare,
2257	And lette as he no3t dutte;
2258	For drede he wolde not dare.
2259	THEN þe gome in þe grene grayþed hym swyþe,
2260	Gederez vp hys grymme tole Gawayn to smyte;

2280	Quoþ Gawayn, ‘I schunt onez,

2284	‘Bot busk, burne, bi þi fayth, and bryng me to þe poynt.

2295	Þen muryly efte con he mele, þe mon in þe grene:

2297	Halde þe now þe hy3e hode þat Arþur þe ra3t,
2298	And kepe þy kanel at þis kest, 3if hit keuer may.’
2299	Gawayn ful gryndelly with greme þenne sayde:

2301	I hope þat þi hert ar3e wyth þyn awen seluen.’
2302	‘For soþe,’ quoþ þat oþer freke, ‘so felly þou spekez,

2305	Þenne tas he hym stryþe to stryke,
2306	And frounsez boþe lyppe and browe;
2307	No meruayle þa3 hym myslyke

2309	He lyftes ly3tly his lome, and let hit doun fayre
