1	7	D	the tallest on earth
1	7	E	he must have been.
1	7	F	His back and breast were great,
1	7	G	but his belly and waist were small.
1	8	A	He was clothed entirely in green.
1	8	B	His spurs were of bright gold.
1	8	C	His saddle was embroidered with birds and flies.
1	8	D	The foal that he rode upon was green;

1	10	C	in the other an axe,
1	10	D	the edge of which was as keen as a sharp razor,
1	10	E	and the handle was encased in iron, curiously “graven with green, in gracious works.”
1	10	F	Thus arrayed the Green Knight enters the hall,
1	10	G	without saluting any one.
1	10	H	He asks for the “governor” of the company,
1	10	I	and looks for the most renowned.

1	11	D	They were afraid to answer,
1	11	E	and were as silent as if sleep had taken possession of them;
1	11	F	some from fear and others from courtesy.
1	12	A	Arthur salutes the Green Knight.
1	12	B	bids him welcome, and invites him to stay awhile.
1	12	C	The knight says that he will not tarry.
1	12	D	He seeks the most valiant that he may prove him.
1	12	E	He comes in peace.
1	12	F	At home, however, he has both shield and spear.
1	12	G	Arthur assures him that he shall not fail to find an opponent worthy of him.
1	13	A	“I seek no fight,” says the knight.
1	13	B	“‘Here are only beardless children.’

1	13	D	Here are brave ones many,

1	13	H	within a twelvemonth and a day.”

1	14	A	Fear kept all silent.
1	14	B	The knight rolled his red eyes about,

1	14	D	Waving his beard awhile, he exclaimed:
1	14	E	“What! is this Arthur’s court?
1	14	F	Forsooth the renown of the Round Table is overturned ‘with a word of one man’s speech.’”
1	14	G	Arthur blushes for shame.
1	14	H	He waxes as wroth as the wind.
1	15	A	He assures the knight that no one is afraid of his great words.
1	15	B	Arthur seizes his axe.
1	15	C	The knight, stroking his beard, awaits the blow, and with a “dry countenance” draws down his coat.
1	15	D	Sir Gawayne beseeches the king to let him undertake the blow.

1	16	A	He asks permission to leave the table; he says,
1	16	B	it is not meet that Arthur should be active in the matter,
1	16	C	while so many bold ones sit upon bench.
1	16	D	Although the weakest, he is quite ready to meet the Green Knight.
1	16	E	The nobles entreat Arthur to “give Gawayne the game.”
1	17	A	The king gives his nephew his weapon,
1	17	B	and tells him to keep heart and hand steady.
1	17	C	The Green Knight enquires the name of his opponent.
1	17	D	Sir Gawayne tells him his name, and declares that he is willing to give and receive a blow.
1	17	E	The other thereof is glad.

1	18	A	“It pleases me well, Sir Gawayne,” says the Green Knight, “that I shall receive a blow from thy fist; but thou must swear that thou wilt seek me,
1	18	B	to receive the blow in return.”
1	18	C	“Where shall I seek thee?” says Sir Gawayne;
1	18	D	“tell me thy name and abode and I will find thee.”
1	18	E	“When thou hast smitten me,” says the knight, “then tell I thee of my home and name;
1	18	F	if I speak not at all, so much the better for thee.
1	18	G	Take now thy grim tool, and let us see how thou knockest.”
1	19	A	The Green Knight
1	19	B	puts his long lovely locks aside and lays bare his neck.
1	19	C	Sir Gawayne lets fall his axe
1	19	D	and severs the head from the body.
1	19	E	The head falls to the earth.
1	19	F	Many kick it aside with their feet.
1	19	G	The knight never falters;
1	19	H	he rushes forth, seizes his head,

1	20	H	The Green Knight then rushes out of the hall, his head in his hand.
1	20	I	At that green one Arthur and Gawayne “laugh and grin.”
1	21	A	Arthur addresses the queen:
1	21	B	“Dear dame, be not dismayed; such marvels well become the Christmas festival;
1	21	C	I may now go to meat.
1	21	D	Sir Gawayne, hang up thine axe.

2	1	A	This marvel serves to keep up a brisk conversation in Court.
2	1	B	The year passes full quickly and never returns.
2	1	C	After Christmas comes the “crabbed Lenten.”
2	1	D	Spring sets in and warm showers descend;

2	3	B	After meat, Sir Gawayne thus speaks to his uncle:
2	3	C	“Now, liege lord, I ask leave of you,

2	4	E	They set steel slices on his feet, and lap his legs in steel greaves.
2	4	F	Fair cuisses enclose his thighs,
2	4	G	and afterwards they put on the steel habergeon,

2	5	A	Thus arrayed the knight hears mass,

2	5	C	By that time his horse Gringolet was ready,
2	5	D	the harness of which glittered like the “gleam of the sun.”
2	5	E	Then Sir Gawayne sets his helmet upon his head,
2	5	F	fastened behind with a “urisoun,”
2	5	G	richly embroidered with gems.
2	5	H	The circle around the helmet was decked with diamonds.
2	6	A	Then they show him his shield with the “pentangle” of pure gold.
2	6	B	The “pentangle” was devised by Solomon as a token of truth.

3	6	D	she would select Gawayne before any man on earth.
3	6	E	Gawayne tells her that he will become her own knight and faithful servant.
3	6	F	The remembrance of his adventure prevents him from thinking of love.
3	6	G	The lady takes leave of Sir Gawayne.

3	7	A	With a laughing glance, she says,
3	7	B	“I am doubtful whether ye be Gawayne.
3	7	C	Were it he, surely, ere this, he would have craved a kiss.”
3	7	D	“I shall kiss,” says the knight, “at your commandment.”
3	7	E	With that the lady catches him in her arms and kisses him.
3	7	F	Gawayne then rises and goes to mass.
3	7	G	He makes mirth all day till the moon rises,

3	8	A	Meanwhile the lord of the land and his men hunt in woods and heaths.
3	8	B	Quickly of the killed a “quarry” they make.
3	8	C	Then they set about breaking the deer.
3	8	D	They take away the assay or fat,
3	8	E	then they slit the slot and remove the erber.
3	8	F	They afterwards rip the four limbs and rend off the hide.
3	8	G	They next open the belly
3	8	H	and take out the bowels.
3	8	I	They then separate the weasand from the windhole and throw out the guts.
3	8	J	The shoulders are cut out, and the breast divided into halves.
3	8	K	The numbles are next removed.
3	8	L	By the fork of the thighs,
3	8	M	the flaps are hewn in two by the backbone.
3	9	A	After this the head and neck are cut off, and the sides severed from the chine.
3	9	B	With the liver, lights and paunches, they feed the hounds.
3	9	C	Then they make for home.
3	9	D	Gawayne goes out to meet his host.

3	10	A	The lord commands all his household to assemble,
3	10	B	and the venison to be brought before him.
3	10	C	He calls Gawayne,
3	10	D	and asks him whether he does not deserve much praise for his success in the chase.
3	10	E	On the knight expressing himself satisfied, he is told to take the whole according to a former agreement between them.
3	10	F	Gawayne gives the knight a comely kiss in return.
3	10	G	His host desires to know where he has gotten such weal.
3	10	H	As this does not enter into the covenant, he gets no answer to his question.

3	11	D	Then they take leave of each other and hasten to bed.
3	11	E	Scarce had the cock cackled thrice when the lord was up.
3	11	F	With his hunters and horns they pursue the chase.

3	12	A	The hunters cheer on the hounds,

3	12	C	All come together by the side of a cliff.
3	12	D	They look about on all sides,
3	12	E	and beat on the bushes.
3	12	F	Out there rushes a fierce wild boar,
3	12	G	At the first thrust he fells three to the ground.
3	12	H	Full quickly the hunters pursue him.
3	12	I	However, he attacks the hounds, causing them to yowl and yell.
3	12	1	fro (?).
3	13	A	The bowmen send their arrows after this wild swine,
3	13	B	but they glide off shivered in pieces.
3	13	C	Enraged with the blows,
3	13	D	he attacks the hunters.
3	13	E	The lord of the land blows his bugle,
3	13	F	and pursues the boar.
3	13	G	All this time Gawayne lies a-bed.
3	13	1	The MS. is here almost illegible.
3	14	A	The lady of the castle again visits Sir Gawayne.
3	14	B	Softly she sits by his side,
3	14	C	and tells the knight that he has forgotten what she taught him the day before.
3	14	D	“I taught you of kissing,” she says, “that becomes every knight.”
3	14	E	Gawayne says that he must not take that which is forbidden.
3	14	F	He is told that he is strong enough to enforce it.
3	14	G	The knight replies that every gift is worthless that is not given willingly.
3	14	H	The lady stoops down and kisses him.

3	15	C	and so renowned a knight,
3	15	D	have never talked to me of love.
3	15	E	You ought to show a young thing like me some token of ‘true-love’s crafts.’

3	16	C	I will, however, act according to your will,
3	16	D	and ever be your servant.”
3	16	E	Thus Gawayne defends himself.
3	16	F	The lady having kissed the knight, takes leave of him.
3	16	1	tornayle (?).
3	17	A	Gawayne rises, hears mass, and then dines.
3	17	B	Meanwhile the lord pursues the wild boar,
3	17	C	that bit the backs of his hounds asunder,
3	17	D	and caused the stiffest of the hunters to start.
3	17	E	The boar runs into a hole in a rock by the side of a brook.
3	17	F	The froth foams at his mouth.

3	18	D	The “swine sets out” upon the man,
3	18	E	who, aiming well,
3	18	F	wounds him in the pit of the stomach.

3	19	C	One wise in woodcraft begins to unlace the boar.
3	19	D	First he hews off the head, then rends him by the back.
3	19	E	He next removes the bowels, broils them on the ashes, and therewith rewards his hounds.
3	19	F	Then the hastlets are removed.
3	19	G	The two halves are next bound together and hung upon a pole.
3	19	H	The boar’s head is borne before the knight, who hastens home.
3	19	I	Gawayne is called to receive the spoil.
3	20	A	The lord of the land is well pleased when he sees Sir Gawayne,
3	20	B	He shows him the shields of the wild boar, and tells him of its length and breadth.
3	20	C	Such a “brawn of a beast,” Sir Gawayne says, he never has seen.
3	20	D	Gawayne takes possession of it according to covenant,
3	20	E	and in return kisses his host,
3	20	F	who declares his guest to be the best he knows.
3	21	A	Tables are raised aloft,
3	21	B	cloths cast upon them,
3	21	C	and torches are lighted.
3	21	D	With much mirth and glee,
3	21	E	supper is served in the hall,
3	21	F	and ever our lovely knight by the lady sits,
3	21	G	who does all she can to please her companion.
3	21	H	When they had long played in the hall,
3	21	I	they proceeded “to chamber.”
3	21	1	ho (?).
3	22	A	There they drank and discoursed.
3	22	B	Gawayne begs leave to depart on the morrow.
3	22	C	His host swears to him,
3	22	D	that he shall come to the Green Chapel on New Year’s morn long before prime.
3	22	E	Our knight consents to remain for another night.
3	22	F	Full still and softly he sleeps all night.
3	22	G	Early in the morning the lord is up.

3	23	A	After mass, a morsel he take with his men.
3	23	B	Then were all on their horses before the hall-gates.
3	23	C	It was a clear frosty morning.
3	23	D	The hunters, dispersed by a wood’s side,
3	23	E	come upon the track of a fox,
3	23	F	which is followed up by the hounds.
3	23	G	They soon get sight of the game,
3	23	H	and pursue him through many a rough grove.
3	23	I	The fox at last leaps over a spinny,
3	23	J	and by a rugged path seeks to get clear from the hounds.
3	23	K	He comes upon one of the hunting stations, where he is attacked by the dogs.
3	23	L	However, he slips them,

3	24	D	But Reynard was wily,
3	24	E	and led them astray over mounts.
3	24	F	Meanwhile the knight at home soundly sleeps within his comely curtains.
3	24	G	The lady of the castle, clothed in a rich mantle,
3	24	H	her throat and bosom all bare,
3	24	I	comes to Gawayne’s chamber,

3	25	D	Great joy warms the heart of Sir Gawayne,
3	25	E	and “great peril between them stood.”
3	26	A	The knight is sorely pressed.
3	26	B	He fears lest he should become a traitor to his host.
3	26	C	The lady inquire whether he has a mistress that he loves better than her.
3	26	D	Sir Gawayne swears by St. John that he neither has nor desires one.
3	27	A	She then kisses him, sighing for sorrow.
3	27	B	She desires some gift,
3	27	C	by which to remember him.
3	27	D	Gawayne tells her that she is worthy of a better gift than he can bestow.
3	27	E	He has no men with mails containing precious things.
3	27	F	Then says that lovesome,

3	28	D	Very sorrowful was that fair one on account of his refusal.
3	28	E	She takes off her “girdle,”
3	28	F	and beseeches him to take it.
3	28	G	Gawayne again refuses to accept anything,

3	29	D	cannot be wounded or slain.”
3	29	E	The knight thinks of his adventure at the Green Chapel.
3	29	F	The lady presses him to accept the lace.
3	29	G	He consents not only to take the girdle, but to keep the possession of it a secret.

3	30	A	Then she takes her leave.
3	30	B	Gawayne then dresses himself,
3	30	C	and conceals the love-lace about his person.
3	30	D	He then hies to mass,
3	30	E	and shrives him of his misdeeds.
3	30	F	and prays for absolution.
3	30	G	He returns to the hall, and makes himself so merry among the ladies,
3	30	H	with comely carols,

3	31	F	The lord takes him out of the hound’s mouth.
3	31	G	Hunters hasten thither with horns full many.

3	32	D	The knight comes forward and welcomes his host,
3	32	E	and according to covenant kisses him thrice.
3	32	F	(See l. 1868.)
3	32	G	“By Christ,” says the other, “ye have had much bliss!”
3	32	H	I have hunted all day and have gotten nothing,
3	32	I	but the skin of this foul fox,
3	32	J	a poor reward for three such kisses.”
3	32	K	He then tells him how the fox was slain.
3	33	A	With much mirth and minstrelsy they made merry,
3	33	B	until the time came for them to part.
3	33	C	Gawayne takes leave of his host.
3	33	D	and thanks him for his happy “sojourn.”
3	33	E	He asks for a man to teach him the way to the Green Chapel.
3	33	F	A servant is assigned to him,
3	33	G	and then he takes leave of the ladies,

3	34	A	kissing them sorrowfully.
3	34	B	They commend him to Christ.
3	34	C	He then departs, thanking each one he meets “for his service and solace.”
3	34	D	He retires to rest but sleeps but little,
3	34	E	for much has he to think of on the morrow.

4	2	D	He wore it not for its rich ornaments,

4	3	A	Then was Gringolet arrayed,

4	3	C	Gawayne returns thanks for the honour and kindness shown to him by all.
4	3	D	He then steps into his saddle,
4	3	E	and “starts on the stone” without more delay.
4	3	F	“This castle to Christ I commend; may he give it ever good chance!”
4	4	A	The gates are soon opened.
4	4	B	The knight passes thereout,
4	4	C	and goes on his way accompanied by his guide.
4	4	D	They climb by cliffs,
4	4	E	where each “hill had a hat and a mist-cloak,”
4	4	F	until daylight.
4	4	G	They were then on a “hill full high.”
4	4	H	The servant bade his master abide, saying,
4	5	A	“I have brought you hither,
4	5	B	ye are not now far from the noted place.
4	5	C	Full perilous is it esteemed.
4	5	D	The lord of that ‘waste’ is stiff and stern.
4	5	E	His body is bigger ‘than the best four in Arthur’s house.’
4	5	F	None passes by the Green Chapel, ‘that he does not ding to death with dint of his hand.’
4	5	G	For be it churl or chaplain, monk, mass-priest, ‘or any man else,’ he kills them all.
4	5	H	He has lived there full long.

4	6	A	Wherefore, good Sir Gawayne, let this man alone.
4	6	B	Go by some other region,
4	6	C	I swear by God and all His saints, that I will never say that ever ye attempted to flee from any man.”
4	6	D	Gawayne replies that to shun this danger would mark him as a “coward knight.”
4	6	E	To the Chapel, therefore, he will go,
4	6	F	though the owner thereof were a stern knave.

4	7	C	till thou come to the bottom of the valley;
4	7	D	look a little to the left,
4	7	E	and thou shalt see the Chapel itself and the man that guards it.”
4	7	F	Having thus spoken the guide takes leave of the knight.
4	7	G	“By God’s self,” says Sir Gawayne, “I will neither weep nor groan.
4	7	H	To God’s will I am full ready.”
4	8	A	Then he pursues his journey,
4	8	B	rides through the dale, and looks about.
4	8	C	He sees no sign of a resting-place, but only high and steep banks.
4	8	D	No chapel could he discern.
4	8	E	At last he sees a hill by the side of a stream;
4	8	F	thither he goes,
4	8	G	alights and fastens his horse to a branch of a tree.
4	8	H	He walks around the hill, debating with himself what it might be,

4	9	C	It is most cursed kirk that ever I entered.”
4	9	D	Roaming about he hears a loud noise,
4	9	E	from beyond the brook.
4	9	F	It clattered like the grinding of a scythe on a grindstone.
4	9	G	It whirred like a mill-stream.

4	10	A	Then cried he aloud,
4	10	B	“Who dwells here discourse with me to hold?”
4	10	C	Now is the good Gawayne going aright
4	10	D	He hears a voice commanding him to abide where he is.
4	10	E	Soon there comes out of a hole, with a fell weapon,
4	10	F	a Danish axe, quite new,
4	10	G	the “knight in green,” clothed as before.
4	10	H	When he reaches the stream, he hops over and strides about.
4	10	I	He meets Sir Gawayne without obeisance.
4	10	J	The other tells him that he is now ready for conversation
4	11	A	“God preserve thee!” says the Green Knight,
4	11	B	“as a true knight ‘thou hast timed thy travel’
4	11	C	Thou knowest the covenant between us,
4	11	D	that on New Year’s day I should return thy blow
4	11	E	Here we are alone,
4	11	F	Have off thy helmet and take thy pay at once.”
4	11	G	“By God,” quoth Sir Gawayne, “I shall not begrudge thee thy will.”

4	12	C	As it came gliding down,
4	12	D	Sir Gawayne shrank a little with his shoulders.
4	12	E	The other reproved him, saying,
4	12	F	“Thou art not Gawayne that is so good esteemed,
4	12	G	for thou fleest for fear before thou feelest harm.
4	12	H	I never flinched when thou struckest.
4	12	I	My head flew to my foot, yet I never fled,
4	12	J	wherefore I ought to be called the better man.”
4	12	K	“I shunted once,” says Gawayne, “but will no more.
4	13	A	Bring me to the point; deal me my destiny at once.”
4	13	B	“Have at thee, then,” says the other.
4	13	C	With that he aims at him a blow.
4	13	D	Gawayne never flinches, but stands as still as a stone.
4	13	E	“Now,” says the Green Knight, “I must hit thee, since thy heart is whole.”
4	13	F	“Thrash on,” says the other.
4	13	G	Then the Green Knight makes ready to strike.

4	14	D	When the knight saw the blood on the snow,
4	14	E	he unsheathed his sword, and thus spake:
4	14	F	“Cease, man, of thy blow.

4	15	A	The Green Knight rested on his axe,
4	15	B	looked on Sir Gawayne, who appeared bold and fearless,
4	15	C	and addressed him as follows: “Bold knight, be not so wroth,
4	15	D	I promised thee a stroke and thou hast it, be satisfied.
4	15	E	I could have dealt worse with thee.
4	15	F	I menaced thee with one blow for the covenant between us on the first night.

4	16	B	I know thy kisses and my wife’s wooing.
4	16	C	I sent her to try thee, and faultless I found thee.
4	16	D	But yet thou sinnedst a little,
4	16	E	for love of thy life.”
4	16	F	Gawayne stands confounded.
4	16	G	“Cursed,” he says, “be cowardice and covetousness both!”
4	16	H	Then he takes off the girdle and throws it to the knight.
4	16	I	He curses his cowardice,
4	16	J	and confesses himself to have been guilty of untruth.

4	17	A	Then the other, laughing, thus spoke:
4	17	B	“Thou art confessed so clean,
4	17	C	that I hold thee as pure as if thou hadst never been guilty.
4	17	D	I give thee, sir, the gold-hemmed girdle,
4	17	E	as a token of thy adventure at the Green Chapel.
4	17	F	Come again to my abode, and abide there for the remainder of the festival.”

4	18	A	“Nay, forsooth,” says Gawayne,
4	18	B	“I have sojourned sadly, but bliss betide thee!
4	18	C	Commend me to your comely wife and that other lady who have beguiled me.
4	18	D	But it is no marvel for a man to be brought to grief through a woman’s wiles.
4	18	E	Adam, Solomon, Samson, and David were beguiled by women.
4	18	F	How could a man love them and believe them not?
4	18	G	Though I be now beguiled, methinks I should be excused.

4	19	A	But God reward you for your girdle.
4	19	B	I will wear it in remembrance of my fault.
4	19	C	And when pride shall prick me,
4	19	D	a look to this lace shall abate it.
4	19	E	But tell me your right name and I shall have done.”
4	19	F	The Green Knight replies, “I am called Bernlak de Hautdesert, through might of Morgain la Fey, the pupil of Merlin.

4	20	C	She is even thine aunt.
4	20	D	Therefore come to her and make merry in my house.”
4	20	E	Gawayne refuses to return with the Green Knight.

4	21	A	Wild ways now Gawayne rides.
4	21	B	Oft he harboured in house and oft thereout.
4	21	C	The wound in his neck became whole.
4	21	D	He still carried about him the belt,
4	21	E	in token of his fault.
4	21	F	Thus he comes to the Court of King Arthur.
4	21	G	Great then was the joy of all.
4	21	H	The king and his knights ask him concerning his journey.
4	21	I	Gawayne tells them of his adventures,
4	21	J	the love of the lady, and lastly of the lace.
4	21	K	He showed them the cut in his neck.
4	21	L	He groaned for grief and shame, and the blood rushed into his face.
4	22	A	“Lo!” says he, handling the lace, “this is the band of blame,
4	22	B	a token of my cowardice and covetousness,
4	22	C	I must needs wear it as long as I live.”
4	22	D	The king comforts the knight, and all the court too.
4	22	E	Each knight of the brotherhood agrees to wear a bright green belt,
4	22	F	for Gawayne’s sake,
4	22	G	who ever more honoured it.
4	22	H	Thus in Arthur’s day this adventure befell.
4	22	I	He that bore the crown of thorns bring us to His bliss!
