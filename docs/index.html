        <h1>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</h1>
        <p>
          This website brings together the text and side-notes of
          Richard Morris (1869), the interlinear glosses from Brunetti, and a translation from Ernest Kirtlan's <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: Rendered Literally Into Modern English</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are undoubtedly errors in the digitization of Morris's text (which certainly differs from that glossed by Brunetti, already requiring considerable alignment work) and I will work over time to correct those errors. Assistance in this endeavour is very much welcome.
